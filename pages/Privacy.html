                <p>For users under the age of 13 or as specified by law in their jurisdiction, certain Microsoft
                    products and services will either block users under that age or will ask them to obtain consent or
                    authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it, including when creating an account
                    to access Microsoft services. We will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data
                    than is required to provide for the product.</p>
                <p>Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other

                    can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages. Parents or guardians can change

                    individual who provided the consent for account creation. For child accounts that do not require
                    parental consent to be created, (e.g., for children who are over the age at which parental consent
                    is legally required), the parent or guardian may still use a family group, but must add the child
                    account to their family group after the account is created. Select Learn more below for more

                    is the core of the consumer Copilot experience. Within this core experience, you can search the web,
                    create text, images, songs, or other outputs, engage with other features like Copilot Vision, and
                    let Copilot interact with other apps, services, and websites to take Actions on your behalf. When
                    interacting with Microsoft Copilot, you enter “prompts” that provide instructions to Copilot (e.g.,
                    “Give me recommendations for a restaurant that accommodates parties of 10 near me”). To provide a
                    relevant response, Microsoft Copilot will use this prompt, along with your location, language, and
                    similar settings, as well as other data you might input into the service (for example, files,
                    images, and visual media) to formulate a helpful response.</p>
                <p>In some markets, Microsoft Copilot can use your prior conversation history to better personalize the
                    product for you based on the information you shared – such as your interests and goals. You can
                    opt-out of personalization at any time. Microsoft Copilot also uses your prompts and related
                    information (like location and language) to provide and improve the Copilot services, including to
                    provide relevant advertising. You can manage your prompt history in product and on the Microsoft

                    (including additional privacy choices) in the product. For more information about these capabilities
                    and your choices, see the <a href="#">Microsoft Copilot FAQ</a>.</p>

                    opt-out of such training. More information about how your data is protected and the controls we

                <p>Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access
                    services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the
                    Surface Hub. Rather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of
                    Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly,
                    providing you with the latest improvements and features. In order to provide this computing
                    experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows. And because Windows
                    is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it. Note
                    that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your
                    organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and
                    process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies,
                    software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device.
                    Additionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access
                    and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the
                    contents of your communications and files.</p>
                <p><b>The Windows Settings</b>, formerly known as PC Settings, is an essential component of Microsoft
                    Windows. It provides a convenient interface for adjusting user preferences, configuring the
                    operating system, and managing connected devices so that you can manage user accounts, adjust
                    network settings, and personalize various aspects of Windows. Windows provides a mechanism for apps
                    to access various device capabilities such as the device’s camera, microphone, location, calendar,
                    contacts, call history, messages and more, while controlling access to your personal data. Each
                    capability has its own privacy settings page in Windows settings, so you can control which apps can
                    use each capability. Here are some key features of Settings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                            language settings, and privacy options. Windows settings uses your microphone when

                            brightness at night time to help you customize your Windows.</p>
